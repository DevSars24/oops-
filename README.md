🚀 Advanced OOPs Concepts in C++
📂 Project Structure
This repository demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++ using real-world examples with clean and meaningful code.

🧠 Concepts Covered
1. ✅ Abstraction
Real-Life Analogy:

When you order food in a restaurant, you don’t care how it's cooked — you just care that it arrives!
This is abstraction: hiding internal details and exposing only functionality.

🔧 Code Example:
cpp
Copy
Edit
class Renderer {
public:
    virtual void renderScene() = 0;  // Abstract method
};
Derived classes like OpenGLRenderer and DirectXRenderer implement their own logic.
Main code just calls renderScene() — it doesn’t care how it works internally.

2. 🔁 Runtime Polymorphism (with Abstraction)
Renderer* render = new OpenGLRenderer();

render->renderScene();

Output depends on the actual object created — even though pointer type is Renderer*.

3. 🧱 Encapsulation
Real-Life Analogy: Your bank account is protected. You can check the balance or withdraw, but you can’t access internal code.

cpp
Copy
Edit
class DatabaseConnection {
    string connectionString;
    bool isConnected;
    
public:
    const string& getConnectionString() const;
    void setConnectionString(const string& connStr);
    void connect();
};
Data is private

Accessed via public methods

Safe control via validation inside setters.

4. 🚗 Inheritance + 🧬 Virtual Inheritance (Diamond Problem Solved)
cpp
Copy
Edit
class vehicle { virtual void move(); };
class car : virtual public vehicle {};
class bike : virtual public vehicle {};
class hybrid : public car, public bike {};
virtual inheritance prevents ambiguity.

Overridden move() in hybrid ensures correct method resolution.

5. 👤 User Profile Class (Custom Setter Validation)
cpp
Copy
Edit
class userprofile {
    string name;
    int age;

public:
    userprofile(const string& n, int a);
    void setage(int a); // Validates input
};
Validates negative input, shows how encapsulation + validation can protect data integrity.
